In a world demanding "AI," the simple, correct, and computationally-trivial backtracking algorithm is no longer "innovative." It's too fast, too efficient, and worst of all, too explainable.

RemingtonRoute is our answer to this "problem."

We are building the "AI-powered remmingtion" that costs $10 million, requires a 50-page user manual, and has a 2% chance of missing... to solve a problem that a 100 dollar "glock" (a backtracking algorithm) solves every single time.

We are teaching a machine to guess the answer, because "guessing" (probabilistic modeling) is what "AI" does.
